==Introduction==
lncRScan (long non-coding RNA Scan) is a pipeline consists of five steps for detecting novel long non-coding RNAs from a set of candidate transcripts annotated by Cuffcompare.

==Steps of lncRScan==
Step 1 'extract_category'-- extract several categories of transcripts, which may contain lncRNAs. The candidate categories can be 'c'(contained), `i' (a transfrag falling entirely within a reference intron), 'j' (potentially novel isoform), 'o'
(generic exonic overlap with a reference transcript), 'u' (intergenic transcript) and 'x' (exonic overlap with reference on the opposite strand).
Step 2 'extract_length'-- extract the transcripts having long exonic length (200nt).
Step 3 'extract ORF'-- exclude the assemblies that have long ( 300nt) putative ORF.
Step 4 'extract PhyloCSF'-- PhyloCSF was recruited to filter the transcripts of protein-coding potential from an evolutionary view.
Step 5 'extract Pfam'-- exclude transcripts with significant domain hits by searching Pfam.

==Install==
1) OS requirement - Unix/Linux

2) Steps
   -- Download "lncrscan" which contains three folders to your home directory MY_DIR.
   -- Set environmental variables on you OS by modifying .bashrc
      $ export PATH=$PATH:/MY_DIR/bin
      $ export PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:/MY_DIR/lib
 
   -- Make all scripts executable by
      $ chmod 0775 /MY_DIR/bin/*
